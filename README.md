# Flappy-Bird-2
This is my first study game on Unity!
It contains non-autoral assets and content, but on this game, the intention was to learn C# for Unity 2D

If you want to "Steal" code or even work on the code to make your own or upgrade it, feel free to do.
But i'm not responsible for any non-authorized usages.
